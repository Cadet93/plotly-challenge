# plotly-challenge

In this challenge you are able to select a test subject by their ID from a drop down list.

After an ID is selected several visualizations will render with data on the bacteria in the individual's belly button.

1. Demographic information about the individual test subject.
2. A bar chart of the top 10 bacterias in the individual's belly button.
3. A bubble chart that gives a visual representation of the break down of bacteria in the individual's belly button.
4. A gauge that shows how many times the person washes their belly button.
